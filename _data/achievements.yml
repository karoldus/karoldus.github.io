    description: "The analysis of gait parameters makes it possible to assess the activity and health status of an elderly person. The paper describes a universal system for recording movement parameters based on acceleration, angular velocity and atmospheric pressure sensors. The recorded results are transmitted to a gateway located in the building where the person is staying, and after processing, they are sent to the PERHEART platform server. The article contains a description of the implemented system and preliminary results of the recording system tests."
